### Code example:

First non-repeating character from CODEWARS:

Write a function named first_non_repeating_letter that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't', since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.

As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the input 'sTreSS' should return 'T'.

If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string ("") or None -- see sample tests.

```javascript
function firstNonRepeatingLetter(s) {
    const prettyS = s.toLowerCase();
    const arr = prettyS.split('')
    const charIndex = arr.findIndex((it, i, arr) => arr.filter(fIt => fIt === it).length === 1);
    return charIndex !== -1 ? s[charIndex] : '';
}
